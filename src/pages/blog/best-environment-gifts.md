  Giving gifts is a wonderful way to show the people in your life you care.
  Gifts are the most impactful and meaningful when they come from a place of
  consideration, showing the receiver that you know what they care about and
  appreciate their unique personality. As environmental issues become more
  prescient, you might find yourself in need of purchasing a gift for someone
  who takes these issues seriously or you may want to uphold your own
  earth-friendly lifestyle while gift shopping. Whatever your needs are,
  searching for the right earth-conscious gift might seem challenging, but
  nowadays there are many companies and non-profits that offer great options.

If you haven’t heard of Articus before, you’ve definitely heard of their cause. This company donates 25% of all profits towards preserving the Arctic against climate change. This company takes civic responsibility seriously — they set out from the beginning to find an environmental issue they could make an impact on. Articus offers a range of beautiful bracelets made with volcanic rock beads and various natural gems stones such as agate, jade, or jasper. They also sell t-shirts and hoodies, giving you a great selection to choose from while still letting you put your money to work for a great cause. 

An item from Articus makes the perfect earth-conscious gift because the gift’s receiver can feel good about knowing they’re supporting important environmental causes like climate change and arctic thawing. The company works with reputable organizations like the WWF to fund projects that will protect the Arctic such as testing ice samples to better understanding how climate change functions and tracking polar bears to study and protect them from human influence. With the ice in the Arctic Sea shrinking by 13.3% every decade, giving an earth-conscious gift from Articus is the perfect way to stay environmentally-friendly while bringing some joy to another person.

Not only is this bottle made with the toughest, BPA free glass, but it also contains an infuser for tea or fruit.
