What better way to feel grounded during turbulent times than by looking towards something bigger than ourselves? A star map that captures the sky and stars on a particular date and time of your choosing is the perfect gift for a time when quarantines have us glued to technology for news up-dates. This gift is a great way to give someone you care about a reminder of a special time and date, providing a much needed momentary escape from the stress of daily life. 

My Star Maps is already head of the quarantine curve; with this gift, you won’t have to leave your home and your purchased gift won’t go through any un-essential travel. My Star Maps provides e-gift wrapping that notifies the gift’s receiver via a specially crafted email that celebrates their gift while also maintaining quarantine and thus reducing any risk. After purchasing, you’ll receive an email that you can forward to your gift receiver whenever you decide to. 

Of all the gifts we’ve gathered for you to choose from, the star map is definitely our favourite due to its originality and perfect adaptation to our quarantine-situation. You can get started on gifting a star map on the [My Star Maps website](mystarmaps.com).

For the coffee lovers in your life, this deca-dent coffee subscription service is quite literally the gift that keeps on giving. Every month your gift receiver will be delivered a new coffee based on a few of the criteria you provide (preferred coffee type and roast), adding some enjoyment they can look forward to every month. 

With Blue Coffee Box, your gift receiver will find that staying home under quarantine is a lot less burdensome with the perfect cup of coffee.

Do you know someone who’s going stir crazy under quarantine? The best way to get out that extra restless energy is with exercise, but our workouts have been seriously hindered by stay-at-home orders. That’s why a gift like Class Pass that provides access to thousands of live or on-demand workouts from top studios around the world is the perfect gift. Whether your gift recipient loves yoga or strength training, Class Pass has something to keep them fit from home while they work from home.

## Wrapping up

In this time of so much change and worry, it can be difficult to focus on the more mundane parts of life we once cared about, like birthdays and gift-giving. Yet, even as we all stay glued to the news while trying to make our time spent in quarantine as productive as possible, it’s vital to balance our days with the tasks and concerns we paid attention to before the outbreak. Giving gifts, whether it be for a special occasion or just to show your appreciation, is a wonderful way to get you out of your head during this worrisome time and also bring some joy to another person. With these three gifts, you’ll be able to maintain social distancing while minimizing any sense of social isolation.
