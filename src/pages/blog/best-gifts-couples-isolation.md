  The coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world, causing the shutdown
  and quarantine of many cities. If you’re experiencing a quarantine, it can be
  a jarring time where suddenly so much of what we concerned ourselves with in
  daily life seems less important. What’s more, being under quarantine for an
  ever-increasing span of time and no end date in sight can even harm our
  relationships. Stress and frustration can lead us to displace our feelings
  unto our partners, creating fights. If you’re seeking to lower tensions in
  your home or just want to show your appreciation for your partner’s support in
  these difficult times, we’ve got three of the best gifts to give your partner
  during the quarantine.
